        "question": "How many life points was Weevil left with after Yugi activated Mirror Force during their duel?",
        "explanation": "Duelist Kingdom functioned under very different rules; Mirror Force would inflict damage to the target based on the difference of ATK between the monster who triggered it, and the other monsters that were destroyed by it. Interestingly, because Weevil's Basic Insect had 2150 ATK, this should've dropped his life points to zero. However, this didn't occur.\nCoincidentally, Yugi also could've destroyed any of Weevil's monsters if he played his Dark Magician in attack mode, but it dealt more damage to use the tactic that he did.",

        "explanation": "Earlier in the duel, Yugi equips the moon card to his Silver Fang to increase his attack. However, when the Silver Fang was destroyed, the moon card stayed on the field. This rule not only violates regular equip spells rules, but also Combat Step rules, as he attacked a magic card instead of another monster on the field.",
